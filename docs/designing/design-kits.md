title: Design kits
---

Our design kits are a work in progress and ever evolving. Use the library as a starting point for your designs. We’ve provided assets in sketch and Figma for you to draw from.

Branding should remain consistent but if new components and patterns are made they should be submitted to the #hackit-design-system-submissions slack channel.

Use the following templates for your submissions:

**Submitting a new component for review:**

- Screenshot
- Name of component
- What the component is for
- Does code exist? y/n
- If code exists, link to the HackIT design system github commit
- Tag designers/devs involved

**Challenging existing components:**

- Screenshot of old component
- Screenshot of new component
- Why the old component wasn’t suitable
- A quick description of what’s changed in the new component
- Does code exist? y/n
- If code exists, link to the HackIT design system github commit
- Tag designers/devs involved

Library assets coming soon. Get in touch with [Joy Suthigoseeya](mailto:Joy.suthigoseeya@hackney.gov.uk)
