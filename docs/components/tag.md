Use a status tag in staff-facing tools to show the progress of a case through a workflow.

Status tags can be useful to show the condition of a team's workload at a glance. They are often presented in tables.

Use [sentence case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/sentence-case) for the words inside a status tag.
